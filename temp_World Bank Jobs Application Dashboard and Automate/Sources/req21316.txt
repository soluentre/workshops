I hold a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and a Master's degree in Public Policy. I’ve been working 5 years in the field, with my most recent working experience as a Research Analyst at the International Monetary Fund. In this role, I was not only responsible for research and visualization, but also implementing internal knowledge management works, including managing division websites, conducting data analysis, and creating training contents for staff. One of the projects I want to highlight is a routine in-house workshop which involves fund-wide learners on our exchange rate prediction model and the tools associated with it. I also published videos and blogs to support the workshop.
