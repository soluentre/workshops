I am current a data analyst at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) strategy department. And Iâ€™ve been working for the World Bank EAP team for a year back in 2018, which was actually the start of my 5-year working experience. My academic background in management always directs me to think more in terms of product visions. During my work at the IMF, I led several internal data and IT projects which improved the department-wide data usage effectiveness. Meanwhile, I also initiated several dashboard designing projects. The outputs are either interactive excel spreadsheets or tableau stories. The creation of those dashboards made it much easier for fund-wide economists to conduct assessment review and cross-version consistency checks. I do know well about the project management tools like Azure board, Jira, etc. These tools helped a lot in my workdays in team collaboration and workflow distribution.
