I passed the CFA program Level III exam in June 2019. And ever since then Iâ€™ve been actively practicing the financial accounting, financial reporting, capital budgeting, portfolio management and statistical research skills in real world cases. During the days at the IMF, I participated in the Disorderly Market Condition program, which used hundreds of high-frequency financial indicators including bid-ask spreads, sovereign yield spreads, etc. to nowcast the market conditions in multiple Emerging Market economies.
