I am highly skilled with ArcGIS, Stata, and Python. During my master study, I started to get familiar with the GIS visualization through a course called Spatial Data Modeling. Later during my days at the World Bank and the IMF, I participated in geographical dashboard design and charts creation with both ArcGIS Pro and QGIS. Some of charts I created were included in one of the Regional Flagship reports.
